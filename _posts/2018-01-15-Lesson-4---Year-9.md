During this lesson we mainly revised what we had learnt from our google sheets work before half term. We went over the uses of the virtual shop and the code used to create the individual cells and changing the currencies of the total sum of items. On the 29th of January we will, receive our written reports and that is why it is necessary for us to also refine our  blogs and our google sheet virtual shop work.
