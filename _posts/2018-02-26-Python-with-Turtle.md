**Python with Turtle**

In this IT lesson we learnt to draw shapes with Python using the repl.it website. At the start of the lesson we also had a talk on GCSE computing and computer science; the skills and mindset needed in order to consider taking it. I think I'm going to take GCSE computing. Only 3 people per class normally do it so the weekly lessons are more 1 on 1 and you learn more. I believe that the world that we are going into in today's modern age, computing gives a valuable skill set to everyday life and gives useful life skills such as project management.

Whilst doing python with turtle we learnt how to rotate and define, also how to import and move forward. Below is a screenshot of the work I ended up with. The work shown below does not work although I did make it work. As the screenshot was taken moments before I finished.
