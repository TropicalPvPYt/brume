In today's lesson we focused on creating discounts on our virtual shops we created last lesson. To do this we had to create the following cells: a total items box which showed the total number of items the user is buying, to do this we simply made a sum function and make it to add up all the cells in a certain range. We also made a box which is where you write the percentage discount you are giving on your product. And right underneath this we made a code which would be used to calculate what you need to times the product price by to get the sum total of the product price including the discount. We also made a box which had the number of products you needed to buy before the discount would be applied. In this case i wrote 5, meaning the shopper would have to buy 5 products before they would get the discount advertised. Beneath that cell is where the majority of the code took place. Beneath that cell was the sum total of the products with the discount. The code we used for this was: =if(G15>=G20,(J2*G18),J2). What this code is saying is that if the total items are more than or the same as the number of products needed to buy before the discount is applied then it will times the total without a discount included by the discount number (if we have a 20% off discount in the discount number cell it will say 0.8, so it times it by 0.8 which will give you the number with the discount included). And finally, underneath that cell I Made a '*Total Money Saved*' box, which basically gets the price of the product with no discount and deducts that from the price of the product with a discount, giving you the money you saved using the discount.
