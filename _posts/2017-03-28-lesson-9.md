    <td>This lesson was by far the most fun. We were tasked to simply write out a page worths of code and then we could just play around with the code. Once I wrote the code I could easily press a number and it would move a section of the robot arm. It worked perfectly.</td>

    <td>I accidently put two pieces of code together which didn't work together so I was stuck for around 5 minutes trying to fix my fault.</td>
