**Lesson 1 - Year 9**

In today's IT lesson we covered the basic formulas in making a virtual shop via google sheets. We were taught how to make a fully functional working system. It includes Data Validation, meaning you cannot incorrectly type an item name. And uses "*vlookup*" to search the different items and their prices like a dictionary as such. =iferror(vlookup(E2, $A$2:$B$11, 2, false), ) is the code I used to find the prices after you type in the item name.
