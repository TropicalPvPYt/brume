**Date and Time - Week 2**

This week we learnt about control flow, this is where the machine can do more than just say what you want it to say, below is a paste of the 6 comparators;

**"**

1. Equal to (==)

2. Not equal to (!=)

3. Less than (<)

4. Less than or equal to (<=)

5. Greater than (>)

6. Greater than or equal to (>=)

**"**

We also learnt about date and time and how to use it in our codes. Below is a screenshot of the code used:
