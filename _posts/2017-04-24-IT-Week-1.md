**Week 1**

This lesson we made a start on *Codecademy* which is a great way to learn the building blocks for many coding languages. We are going to focus on python. We learnt how to use strings and arithmetic equations. Like as shown below:

**"**

*Nice work! So far, you've learned about:*

* **_Variables_***, which store values for later use*

* **_Data types_***, such as numbers and booleans*

* **_Whitespace_***, which separates statements*

* **_Comments_***, which make your code easier to read*

* **_Arithmetic operations_***, including **+**, **-**, *****, **/**, ******, and **%*

"

After we learnt that we made a start on len() and other stuff which can change the uppercase and lowercase of a word.
