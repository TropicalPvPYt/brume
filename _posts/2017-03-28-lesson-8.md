    <td>I first started by reading the instructions from the instruction manual. Once I was familiar with the basic concept of the arm I wrote all the code out and tested it. There happened to be a few cases where I made a spelling mistake and the arm kept spinning until it started to broke. Whoops.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think the time it takes for me to read limited my learning and also like I said above, my spelling mistakes because I am trying to write so quickly.</td>
