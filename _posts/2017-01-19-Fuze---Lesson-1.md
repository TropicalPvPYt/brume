Today was our first lesson in IT. This lesson we started to look at the Raspberry Pi coding language using Fuze. During the lesson we learnt how to do loops and repeats, we also learnt how to change the background colour ( paper=colour ) and the text colour ( ink=colour ) and we started to look at different types of variables such as;

Aliens=1

Print "We have" ; Aliens ; “on Earth”

Wait (3)

Repeat

END

Next lesson we will be looking further into our manual booklet and learn more, exciting features.
