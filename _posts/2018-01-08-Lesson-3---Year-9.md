In this week's lesson we focused on refining and polishing our blogs making sure they were easy to read and we were up to date on our blogs, making sure we had posted a blog about each of our lessons. I focused my lesson upon creating a code to change my background. In this case i changed it to a taco gif. And will probably give my blog subheading a white box around it, making it easier for the viewer to read the headings. At first the background wouldnâ€™t change so I decided to look into my code and with help of Mr Tansley I found that the link to the picture I entered was incorrect. With some further help and judgement I changed the link. A few hours later my blog page updated to what it is at this given moment today.
